# HallyuCast

🛰️ HallyuCast is an open-source effort to document, analyze, and eventually unify the ways Korean broadcasting networks expose their drama and variety show metadata.

## 📌 Goals of the First Version

- Study and document how broadcasters like **SBS**, **JTBC**, **tvN**, and **MBC** structure or expose data
- Create standardized Postman collections or markdown documentation per broadcaster
- No actual data aggregation yet — only documentation and understanding
